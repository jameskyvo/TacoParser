# Taco Parser

An exercise in geolocation, csv parsing, and logging

## Overview

Here's what this program does:

1. It takes a list of Taco Bell Locations imported from a CSV file
2. It parses them into a custom TacoBell class consisting of Name, Latitude, and Longitude
3. It iterates through all of the taco bells and calculates which two are the furthest.
